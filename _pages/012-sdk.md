The .NET SDK was written to be used with all .NET languages. The source code examples in this documentation are written in C#.
The two main entry classes of the SDK are the *DataServiceRestClient* and the *RawDataServiceRestClient*.

##{{page.sections['create']}}

 They can be instantiated in different ways:

###Data Service

Constructor method | Description
-------------------|-------------
```public DataServiceRestClient( string serverUri )``` | Instantiates the client with the server uri passed as string.
```public DataServiceRestClient( Uri serverUri )``` | Instantiates the client with the server uri passed as Uri object.
```public DataServiceRestClient( string scheme, string host, int port, string instance = null )``` | Instantiates the client with the given uri segments.

###Rawdata Service

Constructor method | Description
-------------------|-------------
```public RawDataServiceRestClient( string serverUri )``` | Instantiates the client with the server uri passed as string.
```public RawDataServiceRestClient( Uri serverUri )``` | Instantiates the client with the server uri passed as Uri object.
```public RawDataServiceRestClient( string scheme, string host, int port, string instance = null )``` | Instantiates the client with the given uri segments.

### {{ site.headers['example'] }} Instantiating the data service client for the server running in https mode on host 'piwebserver' on port 8080.

{% highlight csharp %}
var dataserviceRestClient = new DataServiceRestClient( "https", "piwebserver", 8080 );
{% endhighlight %}

### {{ site.headers['example'] }} Instantiating the raw data service client for the uri "http:piwebserver:8082"

{% highlight csharp %}
var rawdataserviceRestClient = new RawDataServiceRestClient( "http:piwebserver:8082" );
{% endhighlight %}

##{{page.sections['use']}}

Each client has several methods which encapsulate the communication with the respective webservice endpoint. The methods are exemplified in the particular section. Each method runs asynchronous, returning the particular task which contains the result after it has finished. A _**CancelationToken**_ can optionally be passed into every method, which offers the possibility to cancel a request.
